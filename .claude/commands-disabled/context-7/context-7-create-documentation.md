Analyze codebase to identify all required or recommended third-party APIs.

Refer to CLAUDE.md, PLANNING.md and TASKS-##.md files if available.

Plan to use the Context7 MCP server to retrieve relevant documentation for each API.

For each API, create an <API-name>.md file in the /documentation folder of my project directory.

Add to the <API-name>.md context for Claude Code, so its completion of a task is fully informed by the necessary context.

For example, https://context7.com/hyprwm/hyprland-wiki, create HYPRLAND-WIKI.md with relevant information that Claude Code needs for configuring Hyprland.
